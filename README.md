**Beyond - Front End Developer Test**

This is over a day of work.
There is room for improvement, and for sure I may have overlooked some glitches.
But I could not invest more time.



Candidate:**Alfonso Florio**

Working url: **http://tom.crystal-bits.co.uk**

Tested with: **Chrome and Firefox**

Frameworks and libriaries:
AngularJS 1.5
Angular Material
UI-router
Ng-Directive-Lazy-Image

Tools used:
Gulp
Bower
NodeJs
LivwReload

Bespoke components:
YoutubeFeed.factory: handles the data logic of the application. Interacts with the youtube API
Preload.factory: handles a preload transtion for the loading states and for the change of URL.
It has a safety timeout, in case of unxpected exceptions.
cutText.Filter: add the three dots to truncate text
EnterKey.directive: checks for the return key in input fields
SearchResults.service: preserves data across views/states - it stores also the scroll position of the search results


*** Pagination
With more time I would have used infinite scroll
