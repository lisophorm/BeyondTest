**Beyond - Front End Developer Test**

This is over a day of work.
There is room for improvement, and for sure I may have overlooked some glitches.
The IE11 troubleshooting alone took 3 hours. So please keep in mind the time I could invest in this wasn't infinite ;-)

Candidate:**Alfonso Florio**

Working url: **http://tom.crystal-bits.co.uk**

Tested with: **IE 11 - Chrome and Firefox**

**Known bug/needs to be fixed**: last results in pagination 
Youtube API returns next page also if we are at the end.

Frameworks and libriaries:

AngularJS 1.5 

Angular Material

UI-router

Ng-Directive-Lazy-Image


Tools used:Gulp / Bower / NodeJs LiveReload

Bespoke components:
**YoutubeFeed.factory**: handles the data logic of the application. Interacts with the youtube API

**Preload.factory**: handles a preload transtion for the loading states and for the change of URL.
It has a safety timeout, in case of unxpected exceptions.

**cutText.Filter**: add the three dots to truncate text

**EnterKey.directive**: checks for the return key in input fields

**SearchResults.service**: preserves data across views/states - it stores also the scroll position of the search results


***** Pagination**
With more time I would have used infinite scroll
